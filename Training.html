    <h1>A Dream<sup>&#174;</sup></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In vision of the dark night <br>
        I have dreamed of joy departed- <br>
        But a waking dream of life an light <br>
        Hath left me broken-hearted <br>
        <br>
        Ah! what is not a dream by day <br>
        To him whose eyes are cast <br>
        On things around him with a ray <br>
        Turned back upon the past? <br>
        <br>
        That holy dream- that holy dream, <br>
        While all the world were chiding, <br>
        Hath cheered me as a lovely beam <br>
        A lonely spirit guiding. <br>
        <br>
        What thought that light, thro' storm and night, <br>
        So trembled from afar- <br>
        What could there be more purely bright <br>
        In Thruth's day-star? <br>
    </p>
